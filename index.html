			<p class="born"><b>Hans Florian Zimmer was born on September 12, 1957, in Frankfurt, Germany. </b></p><br> 
			<hr class="hr1">
			<p class="bio1">His interest in music began at a very early age. He began playing piano at the age of three, but his interest in lessons waned after just two weeks. When he was six years old, he decided that he wanted to become a composer. “My dad died when I was six,” Zimmer told CNN Worldbeat. “That’s when I decided I was going to become really serious about music, because it was my refuge. It was my way of calming the demons in me or at the same time sometimes letting them roar, letting them rip, letting the monster out and seeing that it wasn’t so scary being able to look it in the eye.”</p>

			<p class="bio2">When Zimmer was 14 years old, he moved to England. Throughout his childhood, he was expelled from several different schools because he preferred to study music instead of his schoolwork. When he finally finished school, he began his music career by writing jingles for commercials and playing in rock bands. In 1979, Zimmer, along with Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes, put together a band called the Buggies. The group recorded the album The Age of Plastic, which included the hit song “Video Killed the Radio Star.”</p> <br>
